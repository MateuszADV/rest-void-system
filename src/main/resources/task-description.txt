We would like to create REST service for projects voting system.
Below you may find a list of required functionality (end points)

- we will need a list of projects to be voted for, each list element will have
an identifier, a name and description; it should be sorted by project name

- we will need a possibility of voting for, or against, specific project
each voter will be pre-registered in the system, and will receive unique ID,
voting process will require providing project ID, along with voter ID,
and information if the vote is for, or against the project
each voter can vote only once for specific project

- we will need a possibility of closing the voting for specific project,
it will require project ID as input,
by the way, did I mention that voting for closed projects is forbidden?

- we will need a project details end point, it will require project ID on entry,
and will return project name, description, Â  information if project is open for voting,
and the number of votes for and against it
